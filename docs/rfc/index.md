# RFC Process

This directory hosts proposals that change the Manifesto Specification or add new capabilities.

## Goals

- Provide a transparent path for design changes.
- Enable reviewers (humans and agents) to evaluate impact with a consistent format.
- Record decisions and alternatives for posterity.

## Workflow

1. Open an RFC using the [template](./template).
2. Draft the proposal and request feedback from maintainers and affected implementers.
3. Iterate until consensus. Use RFC 2119 keywords for normative text.
4. When accepted, merge the RFC and create follow-up issues for implementation.

## Status Values

- `draft` — Proposal is being written.
- `review` — Under active discussion.
- `accepted` — Approved for implementation.
- `rejected` — Not moving forward (document the rationale).
- `superseded` — Replaced by a newer RFC (link the successor).
